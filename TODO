General:

Xlib specific:
  ☐ change the implementation of ogamlWindow_xlib to manipulate only one display maybe keep a pointer to the display on C side, and return it whenever ocaml wants one, this avoids an ugly reference on ocaml side
  ☐ change the test in xlib's event_stubs so that it can handle multiple windows on the same display
  ☐ match on clientmessage in ogamlWindow_xlib for safety
